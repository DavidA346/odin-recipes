                <li>Italian sausage</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
                <li>Parmesean cheese</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the lasagna noodle package (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until they're softened and fragrant. Add the ground beef or Italian sausage, breaking it apart with a spatula, and cook until browned. Pour in the tomato sauce, and season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. You can also add some salt and pepper to taste for extra flavor.</li>
                    <li>Boil the Noodles (if using regular noodles): If you're using regular lasagna noodles, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions until they're al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes). Once cooked, drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them if necessary. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of meat sauce. Repeat the layers until you've used up all your ingredients, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
                    <li>Top with Cheese: Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna. This will create a cheesy, golden crust as it bakes.</li>
                    <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown on top.</li>
                    <li>Rest and Serve: Once the lasagna is done baking, let it cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions. Serve with a side of garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete meal.</li>
