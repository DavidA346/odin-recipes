                </ul>

                <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
                <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or your preference)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup diced onions</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>

                <li>Lime wedges for garnish</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Protein: Season the protein of your choice (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, or tofu) with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the protein until browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes depending on the type of protein. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Warm the Tortillas: Heat the tortillas in a dry skillet or on a griddle over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side until warm and pliable. Alternatively, you can wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Tacos: Place a spoonful of the cooked protein onto each tortilla. Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, diced onions, chopped cilantro, and sliced avocado.</li>
                <li>Add Optional Toppings: If desired, add a dollop of sour cream, a spoonful of salsa or guacamole, and a drizzle of hot sauce to each taco.</li>
                <li>Serve: Garnish with lime wedges for squeezing over the tacos. Serve immediately and enjoy the explosion of flavors in each bite!</li>
